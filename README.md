# RLogHostname
RLog but it takes a hostname thats basically it.
This is probably a very heave way of doing this but it works fine. It works great with [ahoy](https://github.com/tmded/Ahoy) this tweak makes my hostname actually work. 
If anyone has a better implementation put in a pr and i will merge it.
